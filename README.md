# Brownian Movement
Brownian motion, also called Brownian movement, any of various physical phenomena in which some quantity is constantly undergoing small, random fluctuations.
A code is written to generate trajectories for a Brownian motion. Generate N of these trajectories, and calculate the average distance and the distribution of distances as a function of time.
